This is a Fix for the mod AddItemMenu for Skyrim SE/AE 1.6.1170 as instructed by leeshaw on Nexusmods.

You can download and install this mod via Vortex as it is. No need to install neither AddItemMenu or AddItemMenu-NG. However, if you wish to make it yourself -- here is the instructions below from leeshaw.

MAKING A VERSION OF AddItemMenu THAT WORKS WITH SKYRIM SPECIAL EDITION  1.6.1170 (or it works for me)
1. Download:
   ⦁AddItemMenu.7z       from     https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563 that's this mod!
   ⦁AddItemMenu-NG.7z from    https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71409

You don't have to unzip any folders in this procedure (at least if you use 7Zip)
2. In AddItemMenu.7z, DELETE the folder: Interface 
   ⦁    In AddItemMenu.7z /SKSE/plugins, DELETE the 2 files: 
   ⦁AddItemMenuSE.dll
   ⦁AddItemMenuSE.ini
3. Copy or Drag FROM AddItemMenu-NG.7z SKSE/plugins TO AddItemMenu SKSE/plugins the 2 files:
   ⦁AddItemMenuSE.dll
   ⦁AddItemMenuSE.toml
4. Using your mod manager e.g. Vortex. Install AddItemMenu

This gives you a single file combining the original AddItemMenu by towawot, 
combined with the SE benefits of AddItemMenu-NG by DarkMatterValkyrie plus the Breakthrough advice of KingVario that gets AddItemMenu working again. Credit and respect to all three.

Special thanks to leeshaw from Nexus for posting this fix! https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/57728106
